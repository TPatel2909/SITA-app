      We, (Employee) and (Supervisor) agree that the above-mentioned areas for development and the type of intervention suggested would be engaged in to achieve the required objective for development. We also understand that due to the operational requirements and budget constraints of the Department (component/unit), it may not be possible to undertake the training and development stated with the type of invention stated and/or within the quarter of the year as stated. There is also an understanding between ourselves that areas for development could be identified throughout the year and that this may change the order of priority and type of invention as stated in the plan.
